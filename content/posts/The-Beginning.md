Hello internet people! I've decided to create this blog as a way to share my projects or any other ideas. I might even try to turn this into my own [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/). Anyways, I decided to build this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), because it's an amazing framework to work with and I really enjoy using markdown files. I have yet to link a CMS to this but I plan on using [Tina](https://tina.io/docs/), mainly because it's a headless CMS that works really well with Hugo. I was able to deploy the website using Github Pages and create a deploy workflow. Hugo happens to have a built-in deploy, so this worked very well! 

Anyways, I plan on using this to post just about anything, so check back to see anything I'm working on! I also plan on using this to do CTF writeups!

Cya!
